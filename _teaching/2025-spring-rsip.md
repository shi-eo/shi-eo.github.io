Remote sensing image processing will focus on various kinds of remote sensing image processing techniques, primarily using optical satellite imagery. The course covers a variety of related topics that include the physical processes involved in remote sensing and various kinds of image-processing methods. The labs will be primarily focused on how to use the image processing software (e.g., ENVI) to analyze remotely sensed imagery.

Course Objectives
======
1.	Relate remote sensing image processing theories for optical sensors.
2.	Use ENVI for analyzing and processing remotely sensed imagery.
3.	Apply different remote sensing image processing methods for solving real-world problems.

Course Outline
======
1.  Introduction to remote sensing and image processing
2.  Data acquisition
3.  Image display & data fusion
4.  Electromagnetic radiation & radiometric correction
5.  Cloud, shadow & snow detection
6.  Geometric correction & mosaicking
7.  Multispectral transformation
8.  Spatial analysis
9.  Thematic information extraction
10.  AI-based information extraction

15.  Final review

Assignments
======
In each class (except 14 and 15), you will complete an assignment that involves one or multiple tasks, mainly using the ENVI software. Student will need to perform some remote sensing image processing techniques and answer questions based on their results. All materials submitted for completion of the assignments must be your work and must be based on your analysis of images. There will be a total of 13 assignments, and they will account for 60% of your total weight. The best 12 scored assignments will be used for final grading, with each one carrying 5% of the final grade.
