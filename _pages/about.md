I am an Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut.

My research focuses on <b> land change science and remote sensing algorithm development</b>, with the broader goal of understanding how human activities and natural processes interact to shape Earth’s surface. To achieve this, I develop physics-informed AI methods and time-series approaches in three main directions: (1) enhancing cloud and shadow detection to improve the reliability of optical satellite imagery, (2) advancing multi-sensor integration and compositing for consistent long-term monitoring, and (3) developing retrospective methods and products to detect and characterize land disturbances and their causal agents. By quantifying and characterizing human-driven and natural disturbances across spatial and temporal scales, my work provides a framework for understanding the coupled dynamics of socio-ecological systems under global change. I have published more than 25 peer-reviewed articles in journals such as <i>Nature Geoscience</i> and <i>Remote Sensing of Environment</i>, with over 2,000 citations (Google Scholar, August 2025). Several of my algorithms and reports, including Fmask and the Landsat 7 orbit analysis, have been operationally adopted or highlighted by NASA HLS, USGS, and Google Earth Engine.
